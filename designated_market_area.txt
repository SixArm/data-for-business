# Designated Market Area

A designated market area (DMA) is a geographic region where the
population can receive the same (or similar) television and radio
station offerings, and may also include other types of media including
newspapers and Internet content.

A.k.a. Television Market Area (FCC term), media market, broadcast
market, media region, or simply market.

DMAs can coincide or overlap with 1 or more metropolitan areas, though
rural regions with few significant population centers can also be
designated as markets. Conversely, very large metropolitan areas can
sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments. Market regions may
overlap, meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market
may be able to receive content from other nearby markets. They are
widely used in audience measurements, which are compiled in the United
States by Nielsen Media Research (television) and Arbitron (radio).
